# [Lost-and-Found] Localisation, Prediction and Intervention for People with Dementia

## About Project 
**Description:** developed an data-driven indoor localization system using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals combined with deep learning to achieve accurate real-time tracking. It incorporates generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data, significantly reducing the need for manual data collection by 50%. The system includes a client-server web app and mobile application designed to detect wandering behaviors in people living with dementia, enabling monitoring in both indoor and outdoor environments.

**Key Features:** 
- High-accuracy AI-based indoor localization using RSS data and feature engineering
- Synthetic data generation with novel GANs method to accelerate training
- Proof-of-concept deployment including web and mobile apps for dementia wandering detection
- User-centered design with input from healthcare professionals, in collabroation with social scientists
